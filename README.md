# Student Performance Prediction

## Description

This project aims to predict student performance using machine learning, specifically focusing on their final grades (G3). It utilizes the Student Performance Data Set from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset contains information about student demographics, social and school-related features, and their grades in Portuguese and Math courses.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Student Performance Data Set, which can be found at the following link:

## Methodology

The project follows these steps:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing:** The dataset is loaded, cleaned, and preprocessed. This involves handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numeric features.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** EDA techniques are used to understand the data and identify patterns. It might include visualizations, descriptive statistics, and correlation analysis.

3. **Model Selection and Training:** We use the Random Forest Classifier for predicting student performance. The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is trained using the training data.

4. **Model Evaluation:** The trained model's performance is evaluated using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy and the confusion matrix.

## Usage

To run this project, you need to have Python 3 installed along with the following libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- requests
- zipfile
- io
- matplotlib
- numpy

You can install these libraries using pip:

-pip install pandas scikit-learn requests zipfile io matplotlib numpy

Then, open the Jupyter notebook and run the cells sequentially.

## Results

The model achieves an accuracy of [insert your accuracy score here] on the test set. 

## Future Work

- Explore other machine learning models and compare their performance.
- Feature engineering to potentially improve model accuracy.
- Analyze the importance of different features in predicting student performance.
